![image](images/sample.png)
 This application designed to facilitate the exploration and in-depth analysis of data from multiple YouTube channels. The app leverages the Google API to retrieve essential channel information, video statistics, and user engagement metrics. With features ranging from data storage in MongoDB to SQL database migration, this app provides a comprehensive platform for deriving insights and making informed decisions.

## Features

1. **Data Retrieval**: Input a YouTube channel ID to retrieve channel details, video statistics, and user engagement metrics via the Google API.
2. **MongoDB Data Lake**: Store collected data in a MongoDB database for future reference and analysis.
3. **Multi-Channel Collection**: Effortlessly gather data from up to 10 YouTube channels by simply clicking a button.
4. **SQL Database Migration**: Seamlessly migrate data from the MongoDB data lake to a structured SQL database for efficient organization and analysis.
5. **Advanced Search**: Utilize SQL database capabilities to conduct advanced searches, including table joins, for comprehensive insights.
